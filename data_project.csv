 to come after our guns. Look for mass shootings."" And then magically, it happened.
This is staged. That's when our world
turned upside down. Again. Alex Jones is the most polarizing figure
 in this nation. It's hard being a white person. SPEAKER: InfoWars was thought of
as a fringe organization. But at its height, more people
were watching than CNN. Unlike controlled media,

radiation levels, you need more iodine. SPEAKER 2: He turned some story

 It's not real. What do you mean
this didn't happen? SPEAKER 3: It started less than
48 hours after the shooting, and then it grew exponentially. JONES: We need to analyze
 all these videos now. SPEAKER 4:
Emails, letters threatening us. SPEAKER 5: It was a contagion
spreading to billions of people. And it was only getting worse. And that's when I filed
the lawsuit against Alex Jones. -BAILIFF: All rise.
-JONES: This is a show trial. The most egregious case of
defamation in American history. Seventy-five million people
 believe that Sandy Hook  -was staged.
-(SIGHS) I believe they're being
fed and manipulated. You believe everything you say
is true, but it isn't. SPEAKER 6: Let's talk about
InfoWars' business model. You put out a story,
it gets people's attention. JONES: Go to infowarsstore.com. SPEAKER 7: InfoWars is actually
an infomercial, right? SPEAKER 6: These families
 have been hunted. And Jones is getting rich
 off it.  It's just so obvious
 what they're doing. That's how he runs his empire.
And that needs to be stopped. JUDGE: You must tell the truth
 while you testify. JONES:
I believe I told the truth. This is a kangaroo court. This is a political action.
 It's a witch hunt. This is not your show. The ladies and gentlemen of

F0Zh1U21Z28,Extraction 2 Trailer Review | Chris Hemsworth | Sam Hargrave | Netflix Movie | Shorts,Extraction 2,"['Action', 'Thriller']","The trailer itself looks much bigger, bolder, 
and action-packed compared to its sequel. After   watching this trailer, one would definitely 
wonder if this movie was really released on   OTT and not getting a theatrical release.
The upcoming sequel follows Hemsworth's   character after the events of the first film, in 
which he was presumed dead at the end. This time,   Rake is tasked with extracting a family who is 
being threatened by a Georgian gangster. His new   mission will take him across Eastern Europe and 
will include infiltrating a high-security prison.  The latest trailer also provides 
the first real look at the villain,   who appears to have a small army at his disposal.
The first “Extraction,” released in April 2020,   was a major hit for Netflix. It was the 
most-watched original film reaching 99   million households in its first four weeks 
of release. Now we need to wait and watch   if this can become the most-watched movie 
on Netflix in 2023. What do you guys think,   please let us know in the comments section below.",174
