Aranmanai 4 - Official Trailer | Sundar.C | Tamannaah | Raashii Khanna | Hiphop Tamizha,"Sir, looks like there was a spat
between husband and wife. The distressed husband took off
to the forest and died of cardiac arrest. And your enraged sister
hung herself to death. My sister's death... is not a suicide. Look here, show off your lawyer skills
in the court! At the same time when
my sister hung herself, few people claimed
to have seen her outside. Something's wrong. I saw the same person in the mortuary
after your sister's death. So, what is that sage saying? He's talking about some ghost
named Baak. -Yesterday night...
-Who's that? I saw an ominous figure
in Shakthi's room. Why don't you do something and control
that Baak with your powers? After taking those two lives, it
has become more powerful now. Mere human powers
cannot control it anymore. Only God's might can save us. Who are you? What do you want? Sir, you were right! Looks like this is the doing
of that sage. But I've a gut feeling that something
is going to happen tonight. On the day of the festival, if it takes over the soul of three people, then that evil spirit will
become an omnipotent force. ARANMANAI 4
